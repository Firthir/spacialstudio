historySection: >-
  Spacial Studio originated from the simple desire to be better. Tim and Michael
  envisaged a company that listened to clients in a more collaborative way.
  Connecting design to software. Software to quantity surveyors and then on to
  tender. All to arrive at a more accurate price and better design outcome. Why
  risk forcing square pegs in round holes?


  To builders a designer can be an impediment to accurate pricing and
  build-ability. To many designers a builder can be stone wall. Spacial Studio
  was founded to break this wall through building experience, design ability and
  software knowledge. We foster relationships to collaborate closely with
  builders to get your project in on price and on time. Every one has a common
  goal. A successful, timely project.


  A mutual desire to implement new directions in software can lead to giant
  steps forward in progress. However, most builders do not have the time to
  research and implement these tools. Design is a cost they are not set up for.
  Spacial Studio conceived a way to put the value back into design in a bottom
  line driven economy. What if you could design to add value to all parties?


  Understanding space only comes from experience. Sometimes experiencing a new
  space is a revelation. With that in mind we relentlessly embarked on a journey
  to a destination miles ahead of the status quo. Ask us about our methods and
  processes.
