# An h1 header

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

{{gallery}}

2nd paragraph. _Italic_, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

* this one
* that one
* the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are
> written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. â˜º
