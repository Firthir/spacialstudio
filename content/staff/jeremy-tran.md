Michael has a long history in Building. He started out in a family of Dutch and Australian Builders and Tradespeople. A solid foundation in trades such as Masonry and Stone Masonry lead to a passion for spaces, structures and finishes. Drafting and Design for construction companies pushed forward into management.

All throughout this evolution there was always study running concurrently. A passion for software integration with Architecture is now of great importance to Michael. He pursues Architecture study along with software research while studying and working in the field. Architecture is truly his passion.

It was when he met Tim that Spacial Studio was born.
